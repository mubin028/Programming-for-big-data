Write a Pig program to analyze the following information.

Step 1: Analyze only the records where minimum_nights>10, number_of_reviews > 10 and the last_review falls within 2018 or 2019.

Step 2. For the records from Step 1, get the general neighborhood_group information and store it with the neighbourhood_group as the 1st column, the average price of the neighbourhood_group as the 2nd column, and the average number of available days for the neighbourhood_group as the 3rd column. Order the results by price, from high to low, and save them to the folder "AirBnB_neighbourhood" in the hdfs home directory.

Step 3: For the records from Step 1, display on the console the room_type, the lowest price for each room_type, and the name of the property with the lowest price for the room_type.
