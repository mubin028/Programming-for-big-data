The training data set in LibSVM format is given. Please write and submit a pyspark program.

 

Using Spark MLlib, train a Ridge regression model with 100 iterations and with intercept. Set the regularization parameter to 0.5. Print out the model weights and intercept.
 

Predict on the following example and show the result:
 

“1:32.9 2:74 3:257.50 4:70.00 5:40.8 6:132.4 7:108.5 8:107.1 9:59.3 10:42.2 11:24.6 12:35.7 13:30.0 14:25.9”

 

Note: In LibSVM format, each line describes an object with a label and some features:

<label> <feature_index1>:<feature_value1> <feature_index2>:<feature_value2> …
